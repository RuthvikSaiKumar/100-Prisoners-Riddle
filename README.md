# 100-Prisoners-Riddle

This is the program written to prove the 100 Prisoners Riddle made by [Veritasium](https://youtu.be/iSNsgj1OCLA).

First it calculates the probability of the prisoners winning on hundred attampts (to calculate the percentage),<br>
then, I repeated it for 1000 times to calculate the average percentage of winning.

Output:
```
| ████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████  | 100 % done
Average number of times prisoners are freed: 30.026%
```

The value comes close to what was expected by Veritasium.

You can repeat the calculation any number of times to calculate precise average (by changing the `times` variable).<br>
You can also change the number of prisoners.

Thank you for reading!
Have a good day :smile:
